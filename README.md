# Optimizing and Testing 

In this Project Students will optimize and test a front-end web application called Study Night, a flashcard tool. Using the skills gained throughout this course, they will create tests to ensure product quality, install and configure necessary project dependencies, and optimize and automate the application tasks.


This project includes the prebuilt Study Night application. Students will install and configure VSCode extensions and npm dependencies. They will apply their testing skills by building unit tests with Mocha to verify logic functionality and end-to-end tests with Cypress to validate form and navigation behavior. To complete the project, students will prepare the application for production by optimizing it manually and using tools like Parcel to minify files and compress images, as well as Gulp to automate testing and build processes.
